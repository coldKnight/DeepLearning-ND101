# Deep Learning

This repository contains a few projects that I did to cement my understanding about the concepts of Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

The projects are using the concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to solve some of the basic real-life problems.

### List of Projects:
 
 1. [CNN](https://github.com/coldKnight/DeepLearning-ND101/blob/master/CNN_Image-Classification/CNN_Image_Classification.ipynb) - Classification of images of the CIFAR-10 dataset
 2. RNN - [TV Script generation](https://github.com/coldKnight/DeepLearning-ND101/blob/master/RNN_TV-Script-Generation/RNN-TV_Script_Generation.ipynb) and [Language Translation](https://github.com/coldKnight/DeepLearning-ND101/blob/master/RNN_Language-Translation/RNN%20-%20Language%20Translation.ipynb)
 3. [GAN](https://github.com/coldKnight/DeepLearning-ND101/blob/master/GAN_Face-Generation/GAN%20-%20Face%20Generation.ipynb) - Generation of faces using MNIST and CelebA datasets
